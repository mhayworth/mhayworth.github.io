        <p>For my Module 5 Digital Storytelling Project, I told the story of this website! Before going into this course, I knew in the back of my head that I wanted to create my own website to show 
            off how far I have come as a developer since the beginning of my time at UF, and I knew that GitHub offers awesome hosting services for free, but I had never gotten around to really making it happen. 
            After finding out that I needed to make an online website for this class, I knew I had the perfect opportunity to work on my web development skills and work hard to get a good grade in this class.<br><br>

            The two tools I explain in the video are VSCode text editor, and GitHub pages for hosting the website. I explain the basics of creating an HTML file that can be read by other people's browsers. 
            My favorite part about a new project is how accomplished I feel when it finally comes to life, but I understand how confusing it can be with all the information out there about web development. 
            Thus, I tried to make my digital storytelling as simple as possible for anyone who would want to follow my steps and create a website from scratch of their own. Hopefully, my work will encourage 
            someone to dive into a new project and learn something new. <br><br>

            I recorded the live coding and tools usage using OBS, while the presentation itself was in Microsoft PowerPoint.
