            <h1>Event Flyers</h1>
            <p>
                The first event flyer I made is an informational flyer for my club, the society of software developers.
                Some design choices I made include the picture superiority effect, as demonstrated through the two images
                that make up the main part of the flyer. Another principle I use is the alignment of the binary along the 
                left side of the image, which spells out the ASCII encoding for "SSD". This made for an interesting flyer 
                that will make people want to visit the next club meeting.
                <br><br>
                The second flyer I made is supposed to be a notice that could be sent out to UF fans and students about 
                the football game's rescheduling to Sunday due to Hurricane Ian. I included the empty space principle, 
                specifically the rule of thirds, to make an open area (the football field) that is both visually appealing 
                and puts extra attention on the text, which is telling the audience that the game has been moved. I also made 
                sure to keep the signal-to-noise ratio as good as possible, with the text being brief but clear, to make sure 
                that anyone who sees this flyer will quickly and easily read the text.

            <h1>Logo</h1>
            <p>
                For my logo, I decided to create a fun version of the logo for my club, the Society of Software Developers.
                I used a circular logo in addition to a fun font to make the club look more approachable. I included contrast 
                between the inner and outer circle, while repeating the color of the outer circle for some of the letters. 
                Additionally, the horizontal alignment of "UF" and "SSD" show that they are two separate acronyms, "University 
                of Florida", and "Society of Software Developers". Even though the letters are tilted to the shape of the circle, 
                it's clear that these letters form two separate words, which makes the logo easier to understand.

            <h1>Infographic</h1>
            <p>
                For my infographic, I used <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> to create an infographic that explains how 
                to become a software engineer for incoming college students. This is why I specifically choose to put statistics 
                about getting a degree first, to encourage a college student to stay in their school until they finish their degree 
                program. Some design principles I used include repetition of the box with text that goes down a grayscale gradient, 
                with the text in the final step being white to show the completion of a student's journey to becoming a software engineer. 
                I also used proximity of the images to their respective sections, such as the graph in the degree section, to emphasize 
                the importance of each point.
