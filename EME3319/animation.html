                My animation project has educational value to a beginner clarinet student learning his or her first scale. Moreover, it could be expanded to include scales 
                in different keys as well as minor scales. Additionally, a teacher could customize the animation to a song that a student is 
                having difficulty learning to help the student visualize how to move their hands. I think another music student that could benefit 
                greatly from this style of animation is an aspiring pianist, as the keys are easy to see and follow.
                <br><br>
                While creating this animation project, as with many of Adobe's development tools, I find that a lot of the simple thing that I 
                think should be easy to access are actually much harder to find. I had to look up how to rotate an image for my Clarinet metronome. 
                It involved right click, digging through a menu, and then digging through a submenu to find the option to flip the image horizontally. 
                Additionally, I found that when navigating to a different keyframe, it would automatically highlight (select) everything within that keyframe. 
                I found this frustrating because in order to change one small thing, I had to click the keyframe I wanted, manually unselect everything, 
                go back to the tool I wanted to use (i.e. text), and then make my changes.
                <br><br>
                Finally, one other feature I would like to see implemented into Adobe Animate to make the process feel better is automatically updating 
                the selected keyframe instead of generating a new one. For example, when I wanted to change the text in one of my keyframes but clicked 
                on the frame after it, it would automatically make a new keyframe next to the existing keyframe. I would like to see a toggle option to 
                either generate a new keyframe or snap back to update the beginning keyframe in your selection.
