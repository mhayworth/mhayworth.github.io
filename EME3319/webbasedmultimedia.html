        <h2>Voki Self-Introduction</h2>
        <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 500px; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.voki.com/site/pickup?scid=19192840&chsm=68370aae75492025dc37e5bcdff172ed" width="100" height="100" scrolling="no">Iframes not supported</iframe>
        <p>
            There is a business value to using a Voki as a digital avatar to represent you and your product. 
            You can create a quick multimedia presentation that adds an interesting layer of personality to your 
            business that many others will not have. I think one drawback to this strategy is that a well-made video 
            of a real person may do the job better than the current digital avatar technology can. Moreover, one downside 
            to this technology is that it lacks the customizability to make a character that looks a lot like you. I tried 
            to pick an avatar that looks as much like me as possible, but I found it difficult to match my face shape. 
            Another thing I noticed was that there were too many options for something simple like lip color, which created 
            decision fatigue. A few pre-set colors could have done the job.
            <br><br>
            I do, however, see a strong value for using a tool like Voki in the classroom. It can be a fun way to have 
            everyone create a representation of how the see themselves. Moreover, a student might not have the time or 
            transportation to film an introduction video at the beach, but with Voki I can easily change my background 
            to the beach. This allows an individual without a production budget like a business to still make a good 
            looking introductory video.

        <h2>Presi Presentation</h2>
        <iframe src="https://prezi.com/p/embed/e6rccqfanege/" id="iframe_container" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" height="315" width="560"></iframe>
        <p>
            Presi has always been one of my favorite tools for creating fun, interesting presentations. One of the business 
            advantages to using a Presi to present information is that it can impress your audience to show that you went 
            the extra mile in creating an engaging presentation, which could reflect well on your business. From an 
            educational standpoint, using Presi is a great tool to get a good grade on a presentation that really stands 
            out from the rest.
            <br><br>
            I think one downside to using Presi is that the website really pushes for you to use the premium version 
            and that you are limited in what you can do with just the free version. I can be a hindrance when you're trying 
            to insert an image quickly in Presi and are then told that the feature of adding images natively is for premium 
            users only. Thus, you lose time in having to find an image on your own, save or copy it, and then embed it 
            into your presentation. I think this is only a small issue, however, and you can still make a great and 
            engaging presentation using Presi.
            <br><br>
            One application where Presi shines is presentations that show a process or bigger picture, as you can 
            zoom out at any point to remind your audience where you are. This is also good for a business timeline 
            that you might be presenting to executives or other managers.

        <h2>Google Slides Presentation</h2>
        <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR7Wm8TYfMtMnhpAeJA9dBAsNF7w-SBidbYIt8dqsNAovImVUUZ9W9NLdDupFuT-aRaMgEGs02D3ag1/embed?start=false&loop=true&delayms=10000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
    <p>
        Google Slides is an especially powerful tool for collaborative presentations because multiple people can work on the 
        project simultaneously. Though I think that it is harder to make a Google Slides presentation look as good as a 
        presentation in a tool like Presi, it is extremely useful for group projects.
        <br><br>
        One area where Google Slides can become frustrating is when two people are trying to work on the content of the 
        same slide at the same time. It can feel like you are stepping on your partner's feet and cause frustration. 
        Another area where I would like to see Google Slides improve is its built-in communication tools. Currently, 
        you can really only leave comments, but longer messages are best to be sent on another platform. I think a 
        feature where you can leave notifications such as a change log for the next person who opens the presentation 
        would be extremely helpful in ensuring successful communication among project groupmates.
        <br><br>
        Finally, I think Google Slides should update some of its themes. Google Slides has been using the same 
        themes for a long time and you can find much better and more engaging themes on third-party websites. However, 
        I feel unsafe at times downloading the data for these themes and would rather have some well-made, niche themes 
        built directly into Google Slides that could be accessed.
