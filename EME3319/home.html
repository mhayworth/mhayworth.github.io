            To me, educational multimedia is the process of applying multiple modes of sensory stimulation to improve the learning 
            process. Multimedia is enhanced by technology because it allows us to more seamlessly create educational content that appeals 
            to more than one sense. When technology is used in multimedia, it allows individuals to demonstrate their technical skills in 
            certain software production tools such as animations, video editing, and photo editing. Going into this course, I thought of 
            multimedia productions as just a set of slides that someone talks over. I now know that this is just one type of multimedia 
            design. While a set of slides with a speaker is a known, successful formula for presentations, it is not always the right tool 
            for the job. For example, I have found that screencasts are extremely effective for teaching people how to use software they have 
            never used before, and animations are a great tool for simplifying a complicated process.
            <br><br>
            It is important for educators to learn how to incorporate multiple forms of media into their curricula as our education 
            system advances and incorporates technology more. Effective use of multimedia can make educational content appear more professional 
            and make the learning process faster. For example, instead of taking the time to write something on a whiteboard, a teacher with strong 
            multimedia presenting skills may instead have prepared slides with animations that he or she can talk over. As we progress, one important 
            factor to remember in multimedia productions is accessibility. When making, for example, a PowerPoint presentation with audio, it is 
            important for the designer to ensure that the same information could be obtained by a blind person, and deaf person, and a person who 
            can both see and hear. This ensures that all people have equal access to educational content and opportunities.
            <br><br>
            In my opinion, the most valuable thing that I have learned in this course is photo editing from the digital images assignment. 
            In my career, I will be presenting information about technology projects, and using well-made digital images as an aide in my multimedia 
            presentations will not only help make the presentations more professional but also demonstrate my dedication to my work. I also learned 
            that there are many powerful and free programs that I can use to enhance my school and professional projects. As an educational technology 
            minor, I hope to apply what I have learned in this course to future educational technology classes and create professional-quality assignments 
            without having to spend extra money on professional-quality software.
