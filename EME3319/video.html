            I decided to create my video storytelling assignment with hurricane preparedness after the most recent hurricane, Nicole. 
            Many people were unsure with what to expect based on news outlets. Especially in the Gainesville area, the storm was not as 
            bad as many groups made it out to be. Proper preparation is important to make sure that you stay safe and comfortable during any hurricane.

            The software that I used to create this project was Movie Maker, downloaded from the course's resource page for Module 6. 
            The software was extremely easy to use, and I was happy with the ability to create text on certain pages to use the full extent 
            of my multimedia production. One area where I was not happy with the suite of tools available to me was the zoom and pan section. 
            I found that the zoom options were very limited in addition to looking elementary and cheezy. Creating the Ken Burns effect was 
            difficult because I could not choose where the image zoomed in to, as it would only zoom to the middle. Thus, I had to use a pan 
            for a shot where I wanted to display hurricane resources to create the Ken Burns effect.
            <br><br>
            The main area, however, where I was disappointed was the video export section. The software did not advertise that there would 
            be a big watermark unless I paid until after I had already finished creating the project. This was frustrating as I felt that 
            part of my hard work would be covered up and the watermark could be distracting to viewers. Since this is a school project and 
            not a commercial work, the point still gets across easily, but I think that the software should make it clear up front that if
             you do not pay you will have a watermark on your finished product.
