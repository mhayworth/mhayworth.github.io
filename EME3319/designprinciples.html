            <h1>Signal vs. Noise Ratio</h1>
            <p>
                The signal to noise ratio can be defined as the ratio of important information to unimportant filler.
                As shown in this picture, this shirt has a very poor signal to noise ratio; it is so full of
                advertisements from sponsors that it's almost impossible to tell what the shirt is actually for.
                In order to keep a strong signal to noise ratio, Reynolds suggests selecting appropriate charts,
                using clear logos and icons, and only emphasizing important items such as titles. Moreover,
                Reynolds shares that, if allowed, unimportant headers and footers should be removed as they
                add noise that takes away from a clear message. However, if an element provides an emotional aspect
                to the message, it can be beneficial to include it even if it is more noise than signal.
                <br><br>
                Some specific design points include making charts 2-D instead of 3-D because 3-D charts are harder to
                comprehend, refraining from including brands or logos on every chart/slide, and a maximum of seven bullet
                points of seven words each per slide. It's important, however, to remember that the signal to noise ratio
                is not the defining element of design and compromises can be made to make a design visually appealing.

            <h1>Picture Superiority Effect</h1>
            <p>
                Put simply, "A picture says a thousand words." Pictures are easier to remember than words and can help create
                a stronger, more memorable idea in a viewer's mind. In this SAAB advertisement, the audience will clearly
                remember the visually exciting image of the car over the sheet full of specifications, even if they
                are the more important thing to consider when buying a car. One interesting thing about using pictures
                in a multimedia presentation is that an audience cannot read and listen at the same time.
                They can, however, process an image and listen at the same time. Therefore, a presentation that involves
                reading text on a screen and hearing a speaker is not effective multimedia.
                <br><br>
                When preparing a multimedia presentation with images, a speaker should look for high-quality images.
                The Reynolds recommends using 800*600 as a minimum, though finding higher quality images is much easier
                with today's camera technology. Even cell phones can take 1080p and 4K images. Finally, displaying a 
                quote over an image using an editing tool can help make that quote more memorable and solidify a key 
                point for an audience.

            <h1>Empty Space</h1>
            <p>
                Empty space can greatly improve the dramatic, emotional, or professional impact of an image or slide.
                Reynolds describes a common mistake among entry-level designers where they are afraid to leave
                any empty space and will fill it with meaningless clip art, logos, graphs, and footers.
                Empty space is useful because it puts more emphasis and focus on whatever actually is on the slide.
                In this famous "your brain on drugs" advertisement, the empty space created by the purposefully
                small font forces the audience to consider the message behind the image.
                <br><br>
                Empty space can be effectively created using the rule of thirds, in which an image is split into
                three sections horizontally and vertically. From the aspect ratio of this image, it could also be thought
                of as four horizontal sections and 3 vertical sections. The leftmost vertical section is almost completely
                empty, creating both a strong signal to noise ratio and empty space that leaves viewers considering
                the important of the message.

            <h1>Contrast</h1>
            <p>
                Contrast is perhaps the easiest design principle to conceptualize and implement in multimedia design.
                I agree with Reynolds' idea that our attention to contrast is a remaining survival instinct. The
                famous "got milk?" advertisement has one of the easiest color palettes to see the contrast in:
                black and white. Contrast is a design element that an audience won't notice when it's good, but will
                definitely notice when it's bad. White text over a yellow background is painfully hard to read, and
                an audience will make that very clear through squinting and straining the eyes to read an image.
                <br><br>
                When designing a multimedia presentation, consider picking out a color palette beforehand. On this
                website, the color palette is light grey (background), medium grey (text bubbles), and a denim blue 
                for text. This creates an easily readable contrast that does not cause eye strain. Always consider
                what colors you are using when designing material for an audience.

            <h1>Repetition</h1>
            <p>
                Repetition is the design practice of using a consistent element. At the end of every McDonald's 
                advertisement, you can expect to see some variation the logo on the left along with the famous
                'ba-da-ba-ba-ba' jingle. This is an example of a repeated element that your brain comes to expect
                and appreciate, as we are wired to look for patterns in what our senses perceive. Repetition can 
                also be seen in this website's design; on every page, the same navigation bar is present. The same
                font size and style is present for every title. The same darker bubble exists around every body text
                box. These are all conscious design choices I have made.
                <br><br>
                However, it is possible to overdo repetition. Repeated design elements that do not provide any
                helpful frames of reference actually take away from a presentation. Remember, in order to
                use a repeated element, it takes away from whitespace and weakens the signal to noise ratio.
                Therefore, choose carefully when deciding which elements of a design are to be repeated and
                which ones should not.

            <h1>Alignment</h1>
            <p>
                Alignment is an invisible line that exists on every visual piece of information. A design
                with good alignment will have clear, straight lines that connect elements. Alignment can 
                help the audience distinguish which elements are related. Some aspects of alignment are
                culturally implanted in us. For example, I didn't tell you that the text box aligned with
                each image was related to it, but our cultural practice of reading from left-to-right 
                led you to automatically read the image, follow the left-to-right invisible line, and then
                read the text box which is meant to accompany it.
                <br><br>
                In my opinion, left-to-right alignment is more important than top-to-bottom alignment.
                For example, the aspect ratio of the pictures I am using on this page are not the same,
                so I could not line them up top-to-bottom without spending hours editing each picture to
                match up perfectly. However, it does not look too bad because each image is perfectly
                aligned at the center with its accompanying text box. Good top-to-bottom alignment can also
                have an interesting effect such as in this mnms advertisement.

            <h1>Proximity</h1>
            <p>
                Although I briefly hinted at this design element in the previous section, proximity
                is the idea that elements that are close to each other will automatically be
                associated with each other. For example, in this Old Spice advertisement,
                the soap itself has nothing to do with the muscular man or the well-groomed 
                horse he's riding. However, when we see them next to each other, our brains 
                associate them as being related. Thus, we equate using the soap with
                being muscular and looking good while riding a horse.
                <br><br>
                Proximity is good for selling an image, but it can also be used to make 
                a design look more cohesive. Reynolds reminds us as designers that 
                nobody should have to try to figure out which caption goes with which image.
                If I put another block of text closer to the Old Spice advertisement,
                you would likely have to spend extra time piecing together that it is 
                supposed to be an example of proximity in design.

            <h1>Important Principle #1: Picture Superiority Effect</h1>
            <p>
                I have selected the Picture Superiority Effect as my most important design principle because 
                it can completely change the visual appeal and effectiveness of a multimedia presentation,
                advertisement, or design. As shown in the SAAB advertisement, we are naturally drawn 
                to the way things look over more objective information. A famous quote,
                "Appearances are everything" reigns true in the context of design to me. A well-chosen 
                picture that sums up what would take a thousand words is a much better use of the audience's 
                time and mental energy. In fact, a truly great design is coherent enough to look like a 
                picture itself. At this point, the audience has been lured in with a picture and tricked into 
                listening to your content!
                <br><br>
                We should all strive to make our designs look picturesque and visually appealing, as that 
                is what truly gets a person's attention.
            </p>
            <h1>Important Principle #2: Empty Space</h1>
            <p>
                I have selected Empty Space as my second most important design principle. This is because 
                empty space can be thought of the backbone of a picture, which was my most important principle. 
                Effective use of empty space allows even the most mundane of topic to appear lively,
                interesting, and professional.
                <br><br>
                One of my favorite uses of empty space in tandem with a picture is in Reynolds' discussion 
                of asymmetrical designs. In nature, pictures are often not symmetrical and thus alignment 
                can be difficult. However, these can still be visually appealing through the rule of thirds: 
                the bottom third is the ground, the middle third is the nature, and the top third is the sky.
                The empty space created by the sky creates an opening to put a meaningful quote or key 
                idea that the audience will take home with them. This is often the most well-remembered 
                portion of a presentation and should thus be valued greatly.
