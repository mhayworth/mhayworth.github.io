            Creating the GitHub tutorial through a screencast was a great way for me to review my own knowledge and share it with others. 
            I think creating a screencast of how to do something would be a great assignment, especially for computer science students, and 
            I have done similar screencasts in my classes before to demonstrate a project.
            <br><br>
            For the assignment, I got a mouse highlighter chrome extension called Cursorlux. It worked well most of the time but at one point in 
            my screencast I had to refresh the page because the visual effect disappeared. For the physical recording of the screencast, I decided 
            to use a Zoom meeting where I turned off my camera. In the past, I've had great experiences with using OBS, and I would recommend it for 
            this course in the future because it is used by many people and well regarded as a powerful, free screen recording tool.
            <br><br>
            My title slide was a PowerPoint page, and I think it worked well. One thing I'd do to improve my screencasts in the future 
            is to try to find a tool that dims tabs that I'm not using. For example, in this screencast I open the command prompt and a 
            notepad session. Because zooming in was not feasible across multiple applications, I decided to just keep in the center in 
            addition to verbally explaining what I was doing. Zooming in videos was not supported with the built-in Windows editing software. 
            Overall, making a screencast is a great way to visually share information and create a tutorial that students can follow along with.
