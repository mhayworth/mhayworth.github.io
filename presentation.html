    <h1>Design Principles and Digital Poster</h1>

    <div class="text">
        <p>For my design principles assignment, I focus on elements of design that enhance the user's experience and make an app more intuitive and usable. I think that a mark of a 
            good application is one where a user who has never opened or seen the app before is able to get the app working with just their basic intuition. A developer should have 
            an average user in mind, and the average user should not have to figure out what the developer was thinking when using an app.<br><br>

            I was very happy with the color scheme and overall aesthetic appearance of my design principles poster, as I feel that I put some of the attributes I focused on in the poster into action. 
            Each section has only 3 bubbles (rule of thirds), with clear empty space between them (white space). Moreover, because there are only 6 clear principles to follow, someone studying this poster 
            would not feel overwhelmed with a lot of design principles to take in at once.

    <div class="text">
        <p>My digital poster focused on LeetCode, a popular technical interview training application. Some design principles I used in this poster were whitespace between each section, 
            the rule of thirds both horizontally and vertically, and Fitt's Law, where my opinions about who should use LeetCode are larger than the other sections that simply describe it. <br><br>

            Overall, my favorite part about both assignments was choosing a color scheme and creating a visually appealing piece of information. I feel that someone would be more likely 
            to want to read and absorb the information when it comes as a visually appealing infographic as opposed to a mundane document with just black and white words.
