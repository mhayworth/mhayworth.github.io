            Before taking this course, I had not realized how involved the instructional design process is. 
            Designing a course from scratch taught me a lot about how I conceptualize and share information: 
            I like to organize my thinking into parent topics and child topics or materials. In computer science terms, 
            I store information as a tree. To efficiently share this information with other people, I need to work on 
            staying on one topic as I traverse this tree of ideas in order. One aspect of the instructional design I 
            had not considered before was the target audience. Making a target audience as focused as possible allows 
            a designer to ensure that their instructional materials will perform as well as possible in both formative 
            and summative evaluations. Before starting this course, I would have thought of an ideal audience for my topic 
            as “computer science majors without front-end experience”. Now, I understand that this idea of a target is far 
            too broad, and a much better audience is “second year computer science majors at the University of Florida”. 
            <br><br>
            As I dived into this target audience, of which I was a member just last year, I began to understand another 
            challenge that instructional designers face: connecting with and understanding the target audience. My target 
            audience described me just months ago, but I already found it hard to remember what I did and did not know at that 
            point in my computer science career. In a professional instructional design scenario where a 35-year-old designer 
            may have been a kindergartener 30 years ago, the importance of getting familiar with your target audience is even greater.
            <br><br>
            Another important concept of the instructional design process that I gained technical skills in this semester is 
            writing performance objectives. Before this course, my objectives may have been “develop usable HTML pages” or 
            “modify the behavior of HTML pages with JavaScript”. Dick's conditions, behavior, and criteria model is a model 
            that I will use beyond this course to clearly define my goals and achievements. Overall, the instructional design 
            process is extremely complex but for good reason; ensuring that a material is of high quality before it reaches 
            students who are subject to strict standards and state goals is necessary. Despite the fact that I do not currently 
            plan to become a computer science teacher/professor, I still plan to use my experiences in this course and my takeaways 
            from the instructional design process to create clear goals for me and my team in professional life.
