<h1>My Experience With the Course</h1>
<div class="text">
    <p>During the course, I learned a lot about the educational technology field. I went into the course from a more technical standpoint, 
        as I am a computer science major and plan to be a software engineer after I get my degree. The course demonstrated to me that educational technology is not 
        as narrow and simple as Canvas and Zoom. Instead, it is a broad field that encompasses the internet, physical tools in the classroom such as smartboards, and the integration 
        of all technology into the learning experience. I feel that during this course, I learned more about how educational technology design decision impact the end user's 
        experience and what aspects of educational technology feel good or bad to use.<br><br>

        I noticed Hick's Law in action during the photoshop assignment. While trying to create my LinkedIn banner, I found that there were so many options and buttons 
        to use that it was difficult to create even the simplest of designs. The Google Suite remained one of the most simple and easy to learn tools I used during the course, 
        as I did most of my written assignments that had to be shared such as slide presentations and infographics in Google Slides.<br><br>

        In the future, I plan to apply what I've learned by designing and software I create around a good user experience that is simple and fulfills as many people's needs as possible. 
        Moreover, I have learned a lot about the importance of accessibility during this course and want to strive to ensure any software I design, create, or work on is usable and accessible by 
        someone who may have a learning or physical disability.<br><br>

        Overall, the field of educational technology is rapidly growing and changing and there's no way to tell what the future holds. Whatever may happen in the next year, ten years, or fifty years, 
        I hope that I am able to continue to adapt to life's many changes and be a part of the design and creation of software tools that will help educate not only the young children but also the adults 
        who should always be striving to learn something new and improve themselves.
