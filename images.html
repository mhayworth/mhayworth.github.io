<h1>Photoshop Image Assignment</h1>

    <p>	My photoshop is a LinkedIn banner that I will use on my profile; therefore the dimensions are 2280x720. I wanted to keep it simple, 
        which mirrors my software engineering philosophy that designs should be simple. I started with a simple white to green gradient as these are two of my favorite 
        colors and would serve as a good background and separate my banner into two distinct sections. In the section with the white, I included some music notes that demonstrate my hobbies 
        outside of software engineering. The notes closer to the white are 80% opacity, while the notes closer to the green are 85% opacity to keep with the darkening of the colors. 
        I also wanted to further demonstrate my ability to use gradients and layer masking to make an image fade into the background. <br><br>

        I chose the image of 1s and 0s for this because I wanted it to look like the banner was being peeled away to reveal the code underneath. As for my name, I decided to center 
        it to the middle height of the banner because I wanted my name to feel like a nametag, as this banner is the first thing many potential recruiters may see when they first open 
        my page. I used the bolder text for my name and the standard text for the subtitle of “software engineer” so that people will first see my name as memorable and see right under 
        that I present myself first and foremost as a software engineer. I also decided to put that I am getting a B.S. in computer science as many people know that UF also offers a B.A.
         in computer science, and I think my degree program being a B.S. gives me a slight advantage over others. <br><br>

        I kept width pixels 400-600 clear on the lower side because on LinkedIn a circle containing your profile picture cuts into the banner, so any time spent working in that area would be a waste. 
        On the right side, however, I decided to include the gator logo, with a drop shadow and a black stroke on the lower half of the image. I felt that these choices helped the gator image flow 
        into the background. Finally, in a much smaller font, I decided to include my website e-portfolio (the one for this class), as I have continued to work on it and become proud of how it looks so
         far. Overall, my hope is that when recruiters see my profile, they will see that I am a well-rounded person who likes to keep things simple. <br><br>

        The photoshop project taught me a lot about a tool I was not familiar with. As I mentioned in the "About" section, I found it difficult to create something very simple because there were so many 
        choices. I think one way I would like to see photoshop improve in this aspect is a "simple" UI option that allows just the most basic functionality for a designer like me who doesn't necessarily
        need the most advanced and intricate tools that Photoshop has to offer.
