    <h1>Productivity Tools assignments</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <p>I took CGS2531 - Problem Solving Using Computer Software simultaneously with this course. Both courses helped me fully understand how much of a timesaver productivity tools such as Excel can be. 
            I was able to clean up over 1,000 data points and get an accurate and visually appealing graph within an hour. I think that before taking both courses, doing this would have taken two hours minimum.<br><br>

            One fear many people hold about productivity tools is that they make things “too easy” and disrupt the learning process. However, I think these fears are unrealistic with careful planning. 
            Before a young student is handed a calculator, they will learn to add numbers by hand. Similarly, before writing up a document in Microsoft Word, a student will learn to write with a pen. 
            I don't think productivity tools take away from education but instead enhance it and allow students to do more and learn more. <br><br>

            One productivity tool I use regularly in my day-to-day work is Google Slides. As a software engineer at an IT company, I was presented with the challenge of creating a system 
            that allows the team to easily visualize what must be done for the day and what is scheduled. I created a program that utilizes the Google API to get the data and display it on an 
            online dashboard that also contains the company's monthly sales, service tickets, and employee progress for each month. Without these productivity tools, such a system would not be possible. <br><br>
