<h1>Career Goals</h1>
<p>My passion is software engineering. I am currently in my first software engineering internship, where I have greatly improved my skills in both frontend
    and backend development. I am hoping to further grow these skills and have a successful career as a software engineer and potential product manager one day.
    There are many places where I dream of working, but I ultimately dream of working at Google as a software engineer. I greatly admire Google's strong work-life
    balance that many software engineers have demonstrated on social media platforms. Google seems to be a very positive environment to work in from amenities like
    a gym and healthy eating options.
</p>

<p>One topic that is very important to me is the environment and sustainability. I would be interested in leading or working at a startup that focuses on using 
    digital technology to reduce waste. For example, I have been thinking about potential solutions to receipts - we all either throw them away instantly or keep them
    in a giant box. I think we can do much better than this. I envision a platform where you tap your phone onto a receptacle to pay, and the receipt is automatically
    downloaded to an app in a lightweight, plaintext format. This would make them not only searchable and sortable by date for convenience, but could also automatically
    be sorted into folders for tax purposes for business owners. This would help people better understand and control their finances too. Ultimately, however,
    my goal in work is to be fulfilled. I always put a lot of effort into whatever work I do, and I want to be able to see and feel tangible results from
    my software engineering work.
</p>

<p>Through my career, I want to be able to not only fund a happy and fulfilling life for my family, but I also want to be able to give back through
    both my time and money for those who are less fortunate than I am. I have been lucky enough to not only have a family that supports me in my 
    college journey, but also a state that provides opportunities such as the Bright Futures scholarship program. Without these, obtaining a 
    college education would be much more difficult for me. I would be interested in using my successful career to sponsor a computer science
    scholarship through the University of Florida. In my time at UF, I have been lucky enough to be a recipient of the Gartner Group Information Technology
    Science scholarship, and I would like to pass opportunities of higher education to future UF students.
