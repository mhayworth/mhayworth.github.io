    <h1>Tech Space Vision</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <p>
            My ideal tech space is an office geared toward software development. The first and most important item in my office would be a computer 
            running macOS; this may be surprising to some because most professionals use Windows. However, many software engineers prefer macOS because 
            the operating system uses the Linux kernel. Without getting too technical, you can run the same commands on a Mac computer that you would 
            run on a Linux server, which is what most software companies use for production. Because configuring a system for software development is 
            a lengthy process, I would prefer a MacBook Pro with at least 16GB of ram for multiple tabs, running programs, and my integrated development 
            environment (IDE).
            <br><br>
            On the topic of IDEs, my preferred IDE is Visual Studio Code, which is developed and maintained by Microsoft. I like it because it has thousands 
            of community-created plugins that can enhance the software development process and is also free. Moreover, my MacBook Pro will need Git installed, 
            which is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same software project at the same time. Finally, my preferred 
            communication platforms include Zoom for video conferences and Slack for short, quick messages.
            <br><br>
            At my desk, I would like to connect my MacBook Pro to two external monitors: one landscape and one portrait. The landscape monitor is great for 
            Zoom meetings or looking through documentation for my software projects, while the portrait monitor is great for coding because you can see more 
            lines of code at once on a vertical monitor. Additionally, I prefer a physical mouse to a laptop-style trackpad, so I would also have a wireless 
            mouse and keyboard that stay at my desk that I can easily use when I need them. One of the upsides to being a software engineer is that almost all 
            work is done digitally, meaning I have no need for a shredder, printer, copier, or scanner because the cost of those items would not be justified 
            by how little I would use them. If I was in a big office, I would use a community printer/copier, or go to my local print store if I was in a home office.
            <br><br>
            One important piece to me that is not technology itself but impacts how we interact with technology is my desk and chair combination. For the desk, 
            I my ideal space has a desk that can be converted between a standing and sitting desk by raising and lowering the top surface. My legs can hurt after 
            sitting for a long time, but I wouldn't want to commit to a fully standing desk in case there was ever a situation where I sprained my ankle or 
            something similar. Therefore, a convertible desk would be a healthy combination that would allow me to stand or sit as needed. My chair is important 
            to me because I get shoulder pain when I have to raise my arms too high to reach my desk, so a chair that is both comfortable to lean back on and 
            adjustable vertically is necessary.
            <br><br>
            Finally, when sharing or leading an in-person presentation, I would like to have a TV wall-mounted on the side of the room. I would like a 
            TV around 55 inches, which would be a good size for presenting to a few people in my office space. To prevent a long cable from stretching 
            across the room, I would get a TV with Apple TV software to enable Screen Mirroring for wireless presentations. Overall, my office space is 
            geared towards an ideal environment for software development and sharing ideas while maintaining my health during work hours.
