            This course has been extremely helpful for me as a computer science major. As someone who is interested in the field of creating educational technology 
            platforms such as LMS, I have learned a lot more about what educators need when creating a course. Some of the features I found extra helpful included drag-and-drop 
            support for moving content within modules. I wanted to add the objectives first in each module but added other content first, so being able to simply drag 
            the objectives to the top was very convenient. Thus, experiencing the LMS from the other side helped me consider what features I would want to implement as a 
            software developer for a educational technology or LMS product. I think that my technical background made this course very familiar for me, as I have studied many course concepts 
            such as software, hardware, AR/VR, and web2.0 before. My main takeaway from the course was in the application of these technologies to the field of education and how  
            we can use technology to create an environment that leads to better learning.
            <br><br>
            In the educational theories assignments, I appreciated the presentations we made and interactions with my fellow class about the behaviorism, cognitivism, and 
            constructivism learning theories. These theories have been one of my greatest takeways from this course, and I plan to apply them to my explanations in everyday life. 
            In the emerging technologies module, I explored the value of augmented reality and virtual reality. One other emerging technology I would like to see discussed in 
            this course is artificial intelligence becuase it can help educators save time on mundane tasks such as creating math problems. Additionally, it can be used 
            by students to help proofread papers and generate project ideas. Of course, artificial intelligence presents issues with cheating, but exploring technologies to 
            detect the improper use of artificial intelligence would be a good topic to cover in the module.
            <br><br>
            Overall, this course has been a very rewarding experience and I am glad to continue to work towards my educational technology minor. The completion of this course
            leaves me with just one other to complete my educational technology minor. On the other tabs in this Course
            ePortfolio, you will find some assignments that I have chosen to display for the final evaluation. Most of the assignments are Google Docs or Google Slides embeddings. 
            Sometimes, the browser will take a moment to fetch the document from the servers. If you open up a tab and do not see any content, just give it a moment and it will load.
