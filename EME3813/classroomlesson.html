            My lesson I created for the Google Classroom assignment was an introduction 
            to web development. It combined a few resources I have created before for various assingments or presentations from my club
            and resources I created new for the assignment. It focused on a walkthrough of basic front-end development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
            and deployment of a website to the internet via GitHub pages. Though I have been on the student side of an LMS before, this was my first experience 
            as a creator/teacher. I found the creation of new content to be relatively simple, and I was able to spend most of the time I set aside for the assignment 
            making high-quality materials, objectives, and assessments. This helped me understand the value of learning management systems: educators can focus 
            more on the content and quality of the course and less on housekeeping aspects like sharing content, distributing announcements, and calculating grades.
